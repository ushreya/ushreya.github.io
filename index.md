**Research Experience**

#Explicit modelling of verbal and non-verbal human sound events with conventional audio-visual context multimedia 
emotion recognition model by considering human events as an auxiliary yet another important modality.
3Developing and improving emotion recognition for induced emotions in movies by using Acoustic sound events cues 
and scene analysis.
#Considering and modelling the annotatorâ€™s perception and its affect on each other by cross-modal attention for fairness
in multimodal multimedia emotion recognition system.
#Building an architecture that takes advantage of integrating ASR network representations as additional input when 
training an acoustic sound event detector
#Code-switching ASR in low resource languages.
Performing sound event localization and detection by transfer learning from sound detection model to localization
